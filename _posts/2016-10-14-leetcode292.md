## Nim Game
#### 题目
>You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.  

>Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.  

>For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

#### 解题思路
>
* n ∈ [1, 2, 3]: 先手胜
* n ∈ [4]: 无论先手的人如何选择，后手的人总能转换成[1, 2, 3]的情况，后手胜
* n ∈ [5, 6, 7]: 先手的人通过分别取走[1, 2，3]颗石头，变成n = 4的情况，先手胜
* n ∈ [8]: 无论先手的人如何选择，后手的人总能到达4关键点，后手胜  
... ...  
可以总结出规律：当n是4的倍数，则后手胜利；当n不是4的倍数，则先手胜利

#### Code
```
public class Solution {  
	public boolean canWinNim(int n) {  
        return n % 4 != 0;  
    }  
}
```

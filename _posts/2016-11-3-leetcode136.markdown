## Single Number

#### 题目
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

##### Note
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

#### 解题思路
**关键：**

* X ^ X = 0
* 0 ^ X = X
* ^ 满足交换律和结合律

#### Code
```
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        
        int len = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            res ^= nums[i];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
